# Global build-lock regression check

`global-build-lock-smoke.groovy` is an **isolated Jenkins init script**. Never
copy it into a production home or execute it in an operational Script Console.
It requires a fresh home under a `mktemp -d` directory named
`rlucene-global-lock-test.XXXXXX`, and refuses to run without the explicit
`RLUCENE_GLOBAL_LOCK_SMOKE=1` opt-in. Bind its HTTP listener to loopback only.
Do not copy credentials, secrets, job data, or production configuration into it.

Prerequisites: Jenkins 2.568.3 WAR, Java 21 or 25, all plugins pinned in
`../deployment/plugins.txt`, and that Jenkins distribution's remoting JAR.
Install the plugins into the fresh home's `plugins/` directory. For example,
use the official Jenkins plugin installation manager with `--latest=false`,
the repository plugin file, and the fresh plugin download directory. An exact
copy of already-installed matching plugin **binaries only** is also sufficient.

Run with the following environment variables:

- `JENKINS_HOME`: `<temporary-directory>/home` (initially no jobs).
- `RLUCENE_GLOBAL_LOCK_SMOKE`: `1`.
- `RLUCENE_LOCK_TEST_REPO`: absolute checkout path containing this change.
- `RLUCENE_LOCK_TEST_REMOTING`: absolute path to the distribution's remoting JAR.
- `RLUCENE_LOCK_TEST_BASELINE_HOOK`: an exported copy of
  `b6021df72:ci/jenkins/deployment/init.groovy.d/rlucene-ci-idle-gate.groovy.override`.

Copy the smoke script to the fresh `home/init.groovy.d/` directory, then launch
the WAR with `-Djenkins.install.runSetupWizard=false`, a bounded Java heap,
`--httpListenAddress=127.0.0.1` and an unused `--httpPort`. This setup is only for
the disposable loopback test server; retain normal security on deployments.

The script starts a real local remoting agent on a second node and runs:

1. Full Declarative validation of all four production Jenkinsfiles, covering
   all five jobs. Heavy bodies are then replaced by small shell probes while
   retaining the actual lock, agent, environment, timeout, and post structure.
2. A deterministic baseline reproduction using the former idle dispatcher:
   CI is already working when a commit job on the other node attempts to work.
   Atomic directory creation detects the overlap; the baseline commit fails.
3. Five simultaneous contenders on two nodes. Exactly one executor works and
   four Pipelines wait for the lock. An atomic marker remains owned through
   post/cleanup, so any overlap causes a failure.
4. The same CI-first/commit-second scenario with the new wrappers, both passing.
5. Controlled failure, execution timeout, holder cancellation and waiter
   cancellation. The next build must proceed and no lock/marker may remain.
6. Re-evaluation of the resource initializer while a holder and waiters exist,
   confirming it preserves ownership and queue state. This is an idempotence
   check, **not** a substitute for an actual controller-restart acceptance test.
7. A waiter spends longer waiting for the lock than its shortened execution
   timeout, then still finishes successfully after acquiring the resource.

Read `<temporary-directory>/result.log`; a successful run ends with `SUCCESS`.
Job consoles and the process-entry/post/exit trace are retained in the temporary
directory for inspection. The script disables its test jobs and terminates its
local agent when finished; stop the test controller process yourself afterward.
No repository checkout, Cargo invocation, mail, or production job is performed.

These checks validate scheduling and cleanup, not Linux resource limits or
single-build peak memory. Repeat the deployment acceptance checks on the real
nodes in a maintenance window before restoring production triggers.
