/// Provides an interface for accessing a point-in-time view of an index.
///
/// Any changes made to the index via an
/// [`IndexWriter`](crate::core::index::index_writer::IndexWriter) will not be
/// visible until a new [`IndexReader`] is opened. If the
/// [`IndexWriter`](crate::core::index::index_writer::IndexWriter) is
/// in-process, it is best to obtain an [`IndexReader`] with
/// [`directory_reader::open_from_writer`](crate::core::index::directory_reader::open_from_writer).
/// When reopening is needed in order to see changes to the index, it is best to
/// use [`directory_reader::open_if_changed`](crate::core::index::directory_reader::open_if_changed),
/// since the new reader will share resources with the previous one when
/// possible. Searching an index is done entirely through this abstract
/// interface, so that any implementation is searchable.
///
/// There are two different types of index readers:
///
/// - [`LeafReader`](crate::core::index::leaf_reader::LeafReader): atomic readers
///   that do not consist of several sub-readers.
///   They support retrieval of stored fields, doc values, terms, and postings.
/// - [`CompositeReader`](crate::core::index::composite_reader::CompositeReader):
///   instances, such as
///   [`DirectoryReader`](crate::core::index::directory_reader::DirectoryReader),
///   can only be used to get stored fields from the underlying
///   [`LeafReader`](crate::core::index::leaf_reader::LeafReader)s. It is not
///   possible to directly retrieve postings from a composite reader; to do that,
///   get the sub-readers via
///   [`CompositeReader::get_sequential_sub_readers`](crate::core::index::composite_reader::CompositeReader::get_sequential_sub_readers).
///
/// [`IndexReader`] instances for indexes on disk are usually constructed with a
/// call to one of the `DirectoryReader::open` methods, for example
/// [`directory_reader::open`](crate::core::index::directory_reader::open).
/// [`DirectoryReader`](crate::core::index::directory_reader::DirectoryReader)
/// implements the
/// [`CompositeReader`](crate::core::index::composite_reader::CompositeReader)
/// interface, so it is not possible to directly get postings from it.
///
/// For efficiency, this API often refers to documents via document numbers:
/// non-negative integers that each name a unique document in the index. These
/// document numbers are ephemeral and may change as documents are added to and
/// deleted from an index. Clients should not rely on a document having the same
/// number between sessions.
///
/// NOTE: [`IndexReader`] instances are completely thread safe, meaning multiple
/// threads can call any of their methods concurrently. If your application
/// requires external synchronization, do not synchronize on the reader instance;
/// use your own non-Lucene objects instead.
