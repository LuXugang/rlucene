/// struct that Posting and PostingVector use to write interleaved byte streams
/// into shared fixed-size byte buffers. The idea is to allocate slices of
/// increasing lengths. For example, the first slice is 5 bytes, the next slice
/// is 14, etc. We start by writing our bytes into the first 5 bytes. When
/// we hit the end of the slice, we allocate the next slice and then write the
/// address of the new slice into the last 4 bytes of the previous slice (the
/// "forwarding address").
///
/// Each slice is filled with 0's initially, and we mark the end with a non-zero
/// byte. This way the methods that are writing into the slice don't need to
/// record its length and instead allocate a new slice once they hit a non-zero
/// byte.
