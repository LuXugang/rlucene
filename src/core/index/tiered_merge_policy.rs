/// Merges segments of approximately equal size, subject to an allowed number of segments per tier.
/// This is similar to [`LogByteSizeMergePolicy`](crate::core::index::log_byte_size_merge_policy::LogByteSizeMergePolicy), except this merge policy is able to merge
/// non-adjacent segment, and separates how many segments are merged at once
/// ([`TieredMergePolicy::set_max_merge_at_once`]) from how many segments are allowed per tier
/// ([`TieredMergePolicy::set_segments_per_tier`]). This merge policy also does not over-merge
/// (i.e. cascade merges).
///
/// For normal merging, this policy first computes a "budget" of how many segments are allowed to
/// be in the index. If the index is over-budget, then the policy sorts segments by decreasing size
/// (pro-rating by percent deletes), and then finds the least-cost merge. Merge cost is measured by a
/// combination of the "skew" of the merge (size of largest segment divided by smallest segment),
/// total merge size and percent deletes reclaimed, so that merges with lower skew, smaller size and
/// those reclaiming more deletes, are favored.
///
/// If a merge will produce a segment that's larger than
/// [`TieredMergePolicy::set_max_merged_segment_mb`], then the policy will merge fewer segments
/// (down to 1 at once, if that one has deletions) to keep the segment size under budget.
///
/// **NOTE**: this policy freely merges non-adjacent segments; if this is a problem, use
/// [`LogMergePolicy`](crate::core::index::log_merge_policy::LogMergePolicy).
///
/// **NOTE**: This policy always merges by byte size of the segments, always pro-rates by
/// percent deletes.
///
/// **NOTE** Starting with Lucene 7.5, if you call [`IndexWriter::force_merge`](crate::core::index::index_writer::IndexWriter::force_merge) with
/// this (default) merge policy, if [`TieredMergePolicy::set_max_merged_segment_mb`] is in conflict
/// with `maxNumSegments` passed to [`IndexWriter::force_merge`](crate::core::index::index_writer::IndexWriter::force_merge) then `maxNumSegments` wins. For
/// example, if your index has 50 1 GB segments, and you have
/// [`TieredMergePolicy::set_max_merged_segment_mb`] at 1024 (1 GB), and you call `force_merge(10)`,
/// the two settings are clearly in conflict. [`TieredMergePolicy`] will choose to break the
/// [`TieredMergePolicy::set_max_merged_segment_mb`] constraint and try to merge down to at most ten
/// segments, each up to 5 * 1.25 GB in size (since an extra 25% buffer increase in the expected
/// segment size is targetted).
///
/// findForcedDeletesMerges should never produce segments greater than maxSegmentSize.
///
/// **NOTE**: This policy returns natural merges whose size is below the
/// [`TieredMergePolicy::set_floor_segment_mb`] floor segment size for
/// [`TieredMergePolicy::find_full_flush_merges`] full-flush merges.
